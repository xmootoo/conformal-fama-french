# Conformal Time Series Forecasting with Fama French Factor Models
Project currently under development. The main idea to test whether Fama-French factors (3 factor and 5 factor) are useful in forecasting of daily returns for S&P 500 using the conformal time series forecasting framework proposed in [Stankeviciute et al., 2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/312f1ba2a72318edaaa995a67835fad5-Abstract.html). Will add more details on usage, core components are stored in `dataloading.py` which constructs the data pipeline and `conformal.py` which
provides the evaluation scripts and statistical framework for conformal time series forecasting.
